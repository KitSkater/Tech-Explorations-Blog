 Context:
Setting up a home lab with a Raspberry Pi 5, old laptops, and a switch.

Using Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) on a Windows 11 PC to bridge Wi-Fi to Ethernet.

After a routine Windows Update, ICS partially broke.

 Observed Symptoms:
ICS service appears to be running.

Ethernet cable lights up; link is active.

Connected devices receive an IP address in 192.168.137.x range.

But:

No default gateway assigned

No DNS server assigned

Result: No internet connectivity without manual intervention.

üîç Diagnosis Steps:
Verified ICS was enabled and bound to the correct adapter.

Confirmed 192.168.137.1 was assigned to the Windows Ethernet interface.

Ran ip a, ip route on Linux client (Kali).

Ping to 8.8.8.8 failed due to missing route.


ü™≤ Conclusion:
ICS‚Äôs DHCP server component is broken post-update.

It hands out IPs but not gateway or DNS info, which breaks NAT routing.

Restarting the ICS service and rebooting devices did not fix the issue.

Most likely introduced by a Windows 11 cumulative or feature update.

 Workarounds:
Manually configure routing and DNS on each device.

Use a dedicated DHCP+NAT box (e.g. Raspberry Pi running dnsmasq or a lightweight firewall distro).

Avoid ICS in production-like lab setups ‚Äî it's fragile and undocumented.

 Lessons Learned:
Windows ICS is unreliable for persistent lab use.

After Windows updates, always re-verify network services and DHCP behavior.

Keep fallback static IP and route configs on hand for connected devices.
Overall, pretty good IT experience using AI tools and troubleshooting. Another note is Verify any bugs on the Microsoft Forms regarding ICS before updating.
